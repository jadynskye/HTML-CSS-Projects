# HTML & CSS Projects

While teaching myself HTML and CSS, I thought it would be a good idea to keep a collection of mini front-end projects to showcase my growth and skills! Built with **HTML5** and **CSS3**, these projects explore UI design, styling, and responsiveness with clean code and interactive elements.

## 📂 Projects

- **Buttons** → Interactive button designs with hover and active effects.  
- **Display & Inline Blocks** → Practicing `block`, `inline`, and `inline-block` with inputs, buttons, and a Google-style search bar [oai_citation:2‡Display and inline blocks.html](file-service://file-6VFBsrsLHkDLSYBQGnoS9z).  
- **Text Styling** → Experiments with fonts, line height, spacing, and UI elements like MacBook ads and coding site snippets [oai_citation:3‡text.html](file-service://file-VcNH72wxaus6hAMjXZgJps).  

(More will be added as the collection grows!)
