# HTML & CSS Projects

While teaching myself HTML and CSS, I thought it would be a good idea to keep a collection of mini front-end projects to showcase my growth and skills! Built with **HTML5** and **CSS3**, these projects explore UI design, styling, and responsiveness with clean code and interactive elements.

## 📂 Projects

- **Buttons** → Interactive button designs with hover and active effects.  

(More will be added as the collection grows!)

## 🛠️ Built With
- **HTML5** – Page structure
- **CSS3** – Styling, hover states, and transitions
